# 🚨 URGENT DATABASE FIX NEEDED

## Current Status
✅ **Flutter app is running** at http://localhost:8080  
❌ **Database schema is missing** - causing "relation public.vans does not exist" error  
✅ **Slack bot is working** but hitting constraint violations  

## The Problem
Your Flutter app has been updated to use the correct `van_profiles` table, but your Supabase database doesn't have the required tables yet.

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema
1. **Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
3. **Copy the ENTIRE contents** of `apply_schema_now.sql`
4. **Paste and Run** the SQL

### Step 2: Fix Slack Bot Constraint (Optional)
If you want to fix the Slack bot van_number constraint issue:
1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
ALTER TABLE van_images ALTER COLUMN van_number DROP NOT NULL;
```

## 📊 What This Will Create
- ✅ `driver_profiles` table (with sample driver)
- ✅ `van_profiles` table (with sample vans #78, #99, #556, #123)  
- ✅ `van_images` table (for storing images)
- ✅ `van_assignments` table (for driver-van relationships)
- ✅ Sample data to test with

## 🎯 Expected Result
After applying the schema:
- ✅ Flutter app will load successfully
- ✅ You'll see sample van data (vans #78, #99, #556, #123)
- ✅ Slack bot will work without constraint errors
- ✅ End-to-end flow: Slack → Database → Flutter

## 🚀 Test It
1. Apply the schema in Supabase
2. Refresh your Flutter app at http://localhost:8080
3. Click "🚐 VANS" to see the van list
4. Upload an image via Slack with "van 123" message

Your app should then display the vans and images!
