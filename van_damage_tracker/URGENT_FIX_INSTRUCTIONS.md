# 🚨 URGENT FIX: Database Schema Missing

## Problem
Your Flutter app shows: `relation "public.vans" does not exist`

## Root Cause
The database schema hasn't been applied to your Supabase project yet.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Apply Database Schema
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `apply_schema_now.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the SQL

### Step 2: Verify Fix
After running the SQL, your Flutter app should:
- ✅ Load without "relation does not exist" errors
- ✅ Display sample van data (vans #78, #99, #556, #123)
- ✅ Show images uploaded via Slack bot

### Step 3: Test Slack Bot
Your Slack bot should continue working and:
- ✅ Accept image uploads with "van 123" messages
- ✅ Store images as base64 in database
- ✅ Create new van profiles automatically

## 📊 Expected Results

After applying the schema, you should see:
- **4 sample vans** in your Flutter app
- **Van #99** with the image you uploaded via Slack
- **No more database errors**

## 🔍 What the Schema Creates

```sql
✅ driver_profiles    - Driver information
✅ van_profiles      - Van information  
✅ van_images        - Images with base64 storage
✅ van_assignments   - Driver-van relationships
✅ Sample data       - 4 vans + 1 driver
✅ Proper indexes    - For performance
✅ RLS policies      - For security
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Apply the schema** - This fixes the immediate error
2. **Test the Flutter app** - Should load van data
3. **Test Slack uploads** - Should continue working
4. **Verify end-to-end flow** - Slack → Database → Flutter

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The Slack bot is already working correctly
- Your Flutter app is correctly configured
- You just need to apply the database schema
- This is a one-time setup step

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

1. Check Supabase SQL Editor for any error messages
2. Verify your environment variables are correct
3. Try refreshing the Flutter app after schema application
4. Check browser console for any additional errors
